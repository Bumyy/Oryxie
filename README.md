- On the top right of the Source Control tab, click the branch selector (default is `main`).
- Switch to the `dev` branch â€” **this is where you will be working**.
- `main` is reserved for production.

- Open and modify a file, e.g., `cogs/pingpong.py`.

- Click the **+ (plus)** icon next to the changed files to stage them.
- Write a descriptive **commit message** in the message box.
- Click the **checkmark (âœ“)** above to commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
- Your changes will now be visible to the whole team.

## 7. Environment Variable Setup

- In the Explorer tab, **copy** the `.env.example` file and **paste** it in the same folder.

- This `.env` file will store your **Discord bot token** and **development server Guild ID**.

- Ask Bumy for the **Guild ID** of the test server.
- Paste it into your `.env` file like this:

```

- Make sure you have Python dependencies installed:

```bash
